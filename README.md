DevOps Technical Assignment:

Introduction:
This repository contains the solution for the DevOps Technical Assignment at Syvora. The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in deploying and maintaining infrastructure, and the ability to solve technical problems in a critical and thoughtful manner.

The assignment includes:
A Node.js/Python backend service with CRUD APIs
Dockerization of the backend service and database
CI/CD pipeline setup
Deployment using Kubernetes (via Docker Desktop).

Requirements:
Backend Service--
A simple backend service created in either Node.js or Python
REST APIs for performing CRUD operations on a database
Any database and table structure can be used to showcase CRUD functionality
The backend service should be dockerized.

Docker and Docker-Compose--
Dockerfile to containerize the backend service
Docker-Compose configuration to run both the backend application and database locally.

Continuous Integration (CI)--
CI pipeline to build a Docker image when code is pushed to the "main" branch
The CI pipeline pushes the built Docker image to Docker Hub.

Kubernetes and Helm--
Creation of a Kubernetes cluster using Docker Desktop
Deployment of the backend application to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts.

Bonus (Optional)
Continuous Deployment (CD) setup to deploy the backend service to the Kubernetes cluster, preferably using ArgoCD
Setup for logging and monitoring of the application in Kubernetes (architecture, alerting, etc.)

Setup Instructions:
Prerequisites--
Docker Desktop (which includes Kubernetes support)
Docker Compose
Helm
GitHub or GitLab for CI/CD setup
A Docker Hub account (for pushing the Docker image).

Local Development:
Clone this repository-
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devops-assignment.git
cd devops-assignment

Build and run the application using Docker Compose-
docker-compose up --build
Access the application via localhost (or the port defined in your configuration).

CI/CD Pipeline-
Set up a CI pipeline in GitHub Actions or GitLab CI that--
Builds the Docker image upon every push to the "main" branch
Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub

Example GitHub Actions configuration:
name: CI Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          push: true
          tags: yourdockerhubusername/devops-assignment:latest
          
Kubernetes Deployment (Using Docker Desktop)-
Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop-
Open Docker Desktop.
Go to Settings > Kubernetes and check "Enable Kubernetes."
Wait for Kubernetes to start.

Create a Helm chart for the backend service.

Deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm-
helm install backend-service ./helm-chart
Access the service through a Kubernetes service or ingress.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement a DevOps solution, from local development to CI/CD and Kubernetes deployment using Docker Desktop. The core aspects of the assignment have been successfully implemented, showcasing proficiency in modern DevOps practices.
